# Abstract
Public health institutions, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), include some socialnetworking tools (such as Facebook, Twitter and others) as a crucial part in the disseminationof reliable health information, monitoring a health crisis and containing of online rumors. InBrazil, the Ministry of Health, to combat the spread of fake news, launched a program, in whichthey made a WhatsApp number available to receive viral information and verify their veracity.However, the complexity of dealing with communication during a health crisis is quite high, associal media, compared to traditional media, are more difficult to monitor, track and analyse. At the moment, Brazil has been identified as one of main epicentres of the COVID-19 spreading,and to get the situation even worse, the current Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro (as well as hisright-wing supporters) is also responsible for spreading misinformation about the coronavirusin his social networks. Given this context, it is important to develop mechanisms tomonitor and mitigate the dissemination of online fake news in Portuguese. The dataset presentedin this paper is composed of 1299 rumors and non-rumors in Brazilian Portuguese identifiedby journalists and by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. It can be used to analyse the fake newscomposition and also to train computational models to detect COVID-19 fake news in Portugueseautomatically.
